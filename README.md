# JdbcStudent

## Student Information Management: CRUD Operations with JDBC Template

### Description

This project is a Spring Boot application that manages student information using CRUD operations with JDBC Template. It allows users to perform Create, Update, and Delete operations on student records stored in a relational database. The project aims to simplify student data management and provide an efficient way to maintain academic records. It ensures data consistency, quick access, and ease of use with a lightweight and scalable solution.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- JDBC Template
- MySQL
- Maven
- REST API

### Student Object Structure

The student entity in this project consists of the following attributes:

```json
{
  "id": 107,
  "name": "john",
  "marks": 79,
  "grade": "C",
  "city": "Chennai"
}
```

Each student has a unique ID, a name, marks obtained, a grade assigned based on marks, and a city of residence.

### API Endpoints

- **Create Student** (POST `/student/add`) - Adds a new student record to the database.
- **Update Student** (PUT `/student/update`) - Updates the details of an existing student.
- **Delete Student** (DELETE `/students/delete/{id}`) - Removes a specific student record from the database.
